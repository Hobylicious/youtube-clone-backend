This is the database string below
Usernames are Shindano, Brian, Francis
Passwords are Shindano1, Brian1, Fancis1
Should be able to just open Mongo compass or mongosh and plug it in
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.zrdag.mongodb.net/db-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Anything auth related is moved to the frontend, it's only a few lines and it doesn't effect anything.
Auth0 and mongoDB are connected by setting auth0 to use a custom database. So the string above is the
cluster that they are both connected with and anyone can use as an admin. Passwords are stored hashed.

I need to customize the auth0 universal login page, I'm going to make the logo the photo that's in our readme.
I also need to work on the userProfile on the frontend, maybe make some forms to change your profile info/picture.

I've been kind of going off that repo but I had to read about everything he did in mongoose 
and I think I have an okay understanding of how everything works. I left it out if I didn't understand.
The code I'm pushing is very similar because this is the only example I could find that used mongoDB
for a youtube clone backend. Anything I didn't understand I left out, like part of his video routes.
I also left out subscription for now.
